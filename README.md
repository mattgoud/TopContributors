```

## Data Sources

composer create-project prestashop/traces
./traces/traces -u <GitHubLogin> -p <GitHubPassword> -o PrestaShop --config="./traces/config.dist.yml"
```

Then place the files into the folder named `public`.

## Development

```bash
# Start development server at http://localhost:3000
pnpm dev
```

## Preview

```bash
# Generate static site
pnpm generate

# preview
npx serve .output/public
```

## Code Quality

```bash
# Lint code
pnpm lint

# Lint and fix issues
pnpm lint:fix
```

## Configuration

### Nuxt Config

The project uses Nuxt 4 with the following modules:

- `@nuxt/eslint` - ESLint integration
- `@nuxt/image` - Image optimization
- `@nuxt/test-utils` - Testing utilities

### Auto-imports

Components from PUIK are automatically imported using `unplugin-vue-components` and `unplugin-auto-import` with the PUIK resolver.

## Docker

Added to this repository is a Dockerfile easing up the image build.

It realies heavily on the [docker multi-stage](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/) feature, in order to provide a clean image for the run.

It also uses the [build arguments](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#set-build-time-variables---build-arg) feature in order to only provide the github credentials during the command line **build**:

```
docker build --no-cache -t top-contributors --build-arg USER_LOGIN={{GITHUB_USER}} --build-arg USER_PASS={{GITHUB_PASSWORD}} -f Dockerfile .
```

Where :

- GITHUB_USER: is the user that will be passed to retrieve the repository informations.

- GITHUB_PASSWORD: is either a token or your github user password, to authenticate with github.

Please advise that with Two Factor Authentication currently being activated, the password authentication method will likely fail and using a token is much preferable.

Then, if you want to locally **run** this image:

```
docker run -p 80:80 top-contributors
```

## Deployment

The development branch is `develop`. Code changes should be merged inside `develop` using Pull Requests.

When you want to deploy latest changes to production environment contributors.prestashop-project.org ;

- open then merge a Pull Request merging branch `develop` inside `main` ([example](https://github.com/PrestaShop/TopContributors/pull/105))
- then publish a GitHub release to trigger the deployment of the production environment
